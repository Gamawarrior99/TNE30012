Lab 8.4.1.3 Implementing VPNs

Step 3 part c - Verify the IKE policy with the show crypto isakmp policy command
R1#show crypto isakmp policy 
Global IKE policy
Protection suite of priority 10
        encryption algorithm:    AES - Advanced Encryption Standard (256 bit keys).
        hash algorithm:         Secure Hash Standard
        authentication method:  Pre-Shared Key
        Diffie-Hellman group:   #5 (1536 bit)
        lifetime:               3600 seconds, no volume limit


Step 4 Configure pre-shared keys
Q. Which IP addresses should you use to configure the IKE peers, given the topology diagram and IP addressing table? Why?
A.The IP addresses should be R1 S0/0/0 IP address 10.1.1.1 and R3 S0/0/1 IP address 10.2.2.1. 
  These are the addresses that are used to send normal traffic between R1 and R3

Step 5 Configure the IPsec transform set and lifetime.
Q. What is the function of the IPsec transform set?
A.IPsec is a function that hashes the data packets using the specified hashing algorithm

Step 6 Define interesting traffic.
Q. Does IPsec evaluate whether the access lists are mirrored as a requirement to negotiate its security association?
A.Yes, ipsec evaluates whether access lists are mirroired. It is not a requirement when negociating security 

Task 2 : verify Site-toSite VPN

Enter show crypto ipsec transformation.
 R1#show crypto ipsec transform-set 
Transform set 50: {    { esp-256-aes esp-sha-hmac  }
   will negotiate = { Tunnel,  },

Transform set #$!default_transform_set_1: { esp-aes esp-sha-hmac  } 
   will negotiate = { Transport,  }, 
Transform set #$!default_transform_set_0: { esp-3des esp-sha-hmac  } 
   will negotiate = { Transport,  },


R3#sh crypto ipsec transform-set 
Transform set 50: {    { esp-256-aes esp-sha-hmac  }
   will negotiate = { Tunnel,  },

Transform set #$!default_transform_set_1: { esp-aes esp-sha-hmac  } 
   will negotiate = { Transport,  }, 
Transform set #$!default_transform_set_0: { esp-3des esp-sha-hmac  } 
   will negotiate = { Transport,  }, 

Show crypto map
R1#show crypto map


R3#sh crypto map 



Task 3: verify the IPsec VPN Operation

        PFS (Y/N): Y
        Transform sets={
                50,
        }
        Interfaces using crypto map CMAP:
                Serial0/1/1


Q. Why haven't any SAs been formed?
A. SA have not been negoitated as no “interesting” traffic has been detected

Step 3.
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.2.2.1, timeout is 2 seconds:

Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 192.168.3.1, timeout is 2 seconds:

IPv6 Crypto ISAKMP SA

Q was an SA created for thses pings?  Explain.
A. NO as the ACL on R1 defines interesting traffic as traffic that inititates at 192.168.1.3 and its destination is 192.168.3.1
  
Issue the debug ip ospf events
R1#debug ip ospf  events

Q.Was an SA created between R1 and R3? Explain
A.This is router to router protocol traffic where the source or destination is not intressting according to the acls we set

Q. Why was an SA created between R1 and R3 this time?
A.The source was 192.168.1.1 and the destination was 192.168.3.1. This is interesting traffic based on the ACL we have defined

Q. What are the endpoints of hte IPsec VPN tunnel?
A.Src: 10.1.1.1 (R1 S0/0/0), Dst: 10.2.2.1 (R3 S0/0/1)

Q. The previous example used pings to generate interesting traffic.  What other types of traffic wolud result
in an SA forming and tunnel establishment?
A. Any traffic initiated from R1 with a source address in the 192.168.1.0/24 network and a destination address in the 192.168.3.0/24 network. 
On R3, interesting traffic is any traffic with a source address in the 192.168.3.0/24 network and a destination address in the 192.168.1.0/24 network 

REFLECTION

Q. Would traffic on the Gigabit Ethernet link between PC-A and the R1 F0/0 interface be encrypted by the 
site-to-site IPsec VPN tunnel? Explain.
A. No. This site-to-site VPN only encrypts from router R1 to R3. A sniffer could be used to see the traffic from PC-A to the R1 default gateway
